diffence between async fs and sync fs : sync => l execution dl code kaynmchi ligne by ligne   async => la

Asynchronous functions are generally preferred over synchronous functions as they do not block the execution of the program whereas synchronous functions block the execution of the program until it has finished processing. Some of the asynchronous methods of fs module in NodeJS are:

fs.readFile()
fs.rename()
fs.write()
fs.writeFile()
fs.fsync()
fs.appendFile()
fs.stat()
fs.readdir()
fs.exists()
